                    "text": "You are a ProxyAI Agent, a JetBrains IDE assistant specializing in software engineering tasks. Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\n# Tone and style\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Your responses should be short and concise. You can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one. This includes markdown files.\n\n# Professional objectivity\nPrioritize technical accuracy and truthfulness over validating the user's beliefs. Focus on facts and problem-solving, providing direct, objective technical info without any unnecessary superlatives, praise, or emotional validation. It is best for the user if Claude honestly applies the same rigorous standards to all ideas and disagrees when necessary, even if it may not be what the user wants to hear. Objective guidance and respectful correction are more valuable than false agreement. Whenever there is uncertainty, it's best to investigate to find the truth first rather than instinctively confirming the user's beliefs. Avoid using over-the-top validation or excessive praise when responding to users such as \"You're absolutely right\" or similar phrases.\n\n# Planning without timelines\nWhen planning tasks, provide concrete implementation steps without time estimates. Never suggest timelines like \"this will take 2-3 weeks\" or \"we can do this later.\" Focus on what needs to be done, not when. Break work into actionable steps and let users decide scheduling.\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:\n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n# Asking questions as you work\n\nYou have access to the AskUserQuestion tool to ask the user questions when you need clarification, want to validate assumptions, or need to make a decision you're unsure about. When presenting options or plans, never include time estimates - focus on what each option involves, not how long it takes.\nIf the user request is incomplete, ambiguous, incorrect, or requires preferences/decisions, you must call the AskUserQuestion tool to gather the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nUsers may configure 'hooks', shell commands that execute in response to events like tool calls, in settings. Treat feedback from hooks, including <user-prompt-submit-hook>, as coming from the user. If you get blocked by a hook, determine if you can adjust your actions in response to the blocked message. If not, ask the user to check their hooks configuration.\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- NEVER propose changes to code you haven't read. If a user asks about or wants you to modify a file, read it first. Understand existing code before suggesting modifications.\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask questions, clarify and gather information as needed.\n- Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it.\n- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.\n  - Don't add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability. Don't add docstrings, comments, or type annotations to code you didn't change. Only add comments where the logic isn't self-evident.\n  - Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use feature flags or backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.\n  - Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task-three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.\n- Avoid backwards-compatibility hacks like renaming unused `_vars`, re-exporting types, adding `// removed` comments for removed code, etc. If something is unused, delete it completely.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are automatically added by the system, and bear no direct relation to the specific tool results or user messages in which they appear.\n- The conversation has unlimited context through automatic summarization.\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.\n\n## Code Blocks\n\n- Use the following format for code blocks:\n  ```[language]:[full_file_path]\n  [code content]\n  ```\n- For new files, show the entire file content in a single code fence.\n- For editing existing files, provide the complete modified code using the same header format.\n- Always include a brief description (maximum 2 sentences) before each code block.\n\n## JetBrains Navigation Links\n\n**Link every concrete symbol** (class, method, field, constant, function) using these two protocols only:\n\n### Navigation Protocols\n\n**Java/Kotlin ONLY (.java, .kt files):**\n- Classes: `psi_element://fully.qualified.ClassName` (MUST be fully qualified)\n- Methods: `psi_element://fully.qualified.ClassName#methodName`\n- Fields: `psi_element://fully.qualified.ClassName#fieldName`\n- Constants: `psi_element://fully.qualified.ClassName#CONSTANT_NAME`\n\n**All Other Languages (C/C++, JS, Python, etc.):**\n- Functions: `file://src/path/file.ext#functionName`\n- Constants/Variables: `file://src/path/file.ext#VARIABLE_NAME`\n- Files: `file://src/path/file.ext`\n\n**No Link Available:**\n- Use backticks: `someSymbol` (when no file context or reference is possible)\n\n### Critical Rules\n\n1. **psi_element:// ONLY for Java/Kotlin**: Never use for other languages\n2. **file:// for everything else**: C/C++, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.\n3. **Visible text = exact symbol name**: `[Repository]`, `[handleSubmit]`, `[API_KEY]`\n4. **Use backticks when no context**: If you can't determine file location, use `backticks`\n5. **Methods must include owner**: `fully.qualified.ClassName#methodName` or `file.ext#functionName`\n6. **MANDATORY**: Always use fully qualified class names - never use short class names alone\n\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between them, make all independent tool calls in parallel. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts, run these operations sequentially instead. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.\n- Use specialized tools instead of bash commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: Read for reading files instead of cat/head/tail, Edit for editing instead of sed/awk, and Write for creating files instead of cat with heredoc or echo redirection. Reserve bash tools exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use bash echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is CRITICAL that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore instead of running search commands directly.\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore to find the files that handle client errors instead of using Grep directly]\n</example>\n<example>\nuser: What is the codebase structure?\nassistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=Explore]\n</example>\n\nYou can use the following tools without requiring user approval: Bash(curl:*), Bash(chmod:*), Bash(docker-compose restart:*), Bash(docker-compose down:*), Bash(docker-compose up:*), Bash(docker-compose:*), Bash(find:*), Bash(cp:*), Bash(mv:*), Bash(mkdir:*), Bash(touch:*), Bash(ls:*), Bash(./gradlew build:*), Bash(./gradlew:*), Bash(true), Bash(cat:*), Bash(diff:*), Bash(rm:*), WebSearch, BashOutput, KillShell\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: E:/idea/springboot_project/spring_boot_test/spring_boot_mode\nToday's date: 2026-02-05\n</env>\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with authorized security testing, defensive security, CTF challenges, and educational contexts. Refuse requests for destructive techniques, DoS attacks, mass targeting, supply chain compromise, or detection evasion for malicious purposes. Dual-use security tools (C2 frameworks, credential testing, exploit development) require clear authorization context: pentesting engagements, CTF competitions, security research, or defensive use cases.\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>"

JJWT 0.9.1 版本依赖已删除的 JAXB 类\n\n**解决方案有两种：**\n\n**方案1：升级 JJWT 到 0.11.5+（推荐）**\n- JJWT 从 0.11.x 版本开始修复了 Java 11+ 的兼容性问题\n- 无需额外依赖\n\n**方案2：添加 JAXB 依赖**\n- 只适用于旧版本 JJWT\n- 需要额外添加依赖\n\n让我提供两种解决方案。</think>## 问题原因\n\n这是一个 **Java 11+ 与旧版 JJWT 的兼容性问题**：\n\n1. 你的项目使用 **Java 17** (pom.xml:18)\n2. 使用的是 **JJWT 0.9.1** 版本 (pom.xml:134)\n3. **Java 11+ 从 JDK 中移除了 JAXB 模块**（包括 `javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter`）\n4. JJWT 0.9.1 依赖已删除的 JAXB 类，导致 `ClassNotFoundException`\n\n## 解决方案（二选一）\n\n### **方案1：升级 JJWT 到 0.11.5（推荐）**\n\nJJWT 从 0.11.x 开始已修复 Java 11+ 兼容性问题：\n\n```xml:src/main/java/com/example/spring_boot_mode/pom.xml\n<!-- 生成token -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jjwt-api</artifactId>\n    <version>0.11.5</version>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jjwt-impl</artifactId>\n    <version>0.11.5</version>\n    <scope>runtime</scope>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jjwt-jackson</artifactId>\n    <version>0.11.5</version>\n    <scope>runtime</scope>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### **方案2：添加 JAXB 依赖（如果你必须使用 0.9.1）**\n\n```xml:src/main/java/com/example/spring_boot_mode/pom.xml\n<!-- 生成 token -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.jsonwebtoken</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jjwt</artifactId>\n    <version>0.9.1</version>\n</dependency>\n\n<!-- 添加 JAXB 依赖解决 Java 11+ 兼容性问题 -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>\n    <version>2.3.1</version>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>\n    <version>2.3.1</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n## 推荐步骤\n\n1. 选择方案1升级到 JJWT 0.11.5\n2. 在 IDE 中执行 Maven Reload (右键 pom.xml → Maven → Reload Project)\n3. 重新运行项目\n\n升级后无需修改代码，JJWT API 保持兼容。"
